### Presentation

I am French with a Post Ph.D in Machine Learning[^10].
Furthermore I love web programming and design.

I am currently working for Vigiglobe.
The first six months I worked with `node.js` (API/MongoDB/Web).
Then we upgraded our stack to _Clojure, Haskell, Mesos, Kafka, Druid_, etc...
At that time we were two to make all technical decisions.
In the end we made a real time analytics of social media content on a scalable architecture.
Actually our architecture is able to manage (Aggregation &amp; Machine Learning) thousands of messages per second.[^7]
In particular, I've written an Haskell twitter stream absorber able to handle thousands of tweets per seconds. And I coded myself a real time sentiment analysis module taking algebraic properties into account to optimize its efficiency.

- During my Ph.D. I made a C++ program (github[^1] and resume[^2]).
  I coded most of standard HMM learning algorithms.
  I developed an algorithm which I invented during my Ph.D. which use some operational optimization algorithm.
  During this period I published articles in international conferences and
  I taught Computer Science to college students.

- At the Hubert Curien Laboratory I made my post Ph.D.
  I developed a scientific application in Java/applet/JWS that should be used by biologists.
  The code has been updated a bit since my 6 month post Ph.D[^3].

- I worked in the web industry for Airfrance.
  My work environment was quite heterogeneous.
  From shell scripting to manage huge amount of data, web design
  and production environment.

- I worked for GridPocket (I am a co-founder).
  This is a French startup specialized in Electric Grid.
  I created a private[^6] web application.

- I've also written an iOS application to manage passwords[^4].

- I am the author of some quite popular blog posts[^5].
