# What did I done?

- Written a thesis in Machine Learning about Probabilistic Automata Inference.
- Published results about this thesis in major international conferences: [ICALP&nbsp;2003], [COLT&nbsp;2004] _&_ [COLT&nbsp;2006].
- DEES: a 10.000 line C++ command line program. This program implement most [HMM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) standard algorithms _&_ inference algorithms.
- [SeDiL](http://labh-curien.univ-st-etienne.fr/SEDiL/): a Java application using Swing UI. The goal is to provide biologist an easy way to use an algorithm that generate Similarity Matrices for strings but also for Tree structures. Most graphics was done by me, including the drawing of trees. I didn't used a library for that purpose.
- An API oriented Ruby framework. For now it is not public.
- For GridPocket I have made two private API server. They manage Electric consumption information.
- I have made a full javascript oriented website to display Electric consumption in real time.
- [krambook](http://krambook.espozito.com): the engine I use to create this document. I exported it in HTML, PDF (using %latex) and SVG.
- Many other things, like some small Mac OS X screensaver, a MetaPost plugin to draw Automata, an RFC-like document to help my student to make a TOR like network, etc...
