### Presentation

I'm a French geek with a Post Ph.D in Machine Learning[^10]. 
I then learned a lot about web programming and design.

- During my Ph.D. I made a relatively big C++ program (github[^1] and resume[^2]).
  I coded most of standard HMM learning algorithm plus the one I developed.
  During this period I made a lot of math, 
  published some articles in very good international conferences and 
  I taught Computer Science to college students.

- I made my post Ph.D. at the Hubert Curien Laboratory.
  I made a scientific Java application/applet/JWS that should be used by biologists.
  The code has been updated a bit since my 6 month post Ph.D[^3].

- I currently work in the web industry for Airfrance.
  My work environment is quite heterogeneous. 
  From shell scripting to manage mass content changes to web design 
  passing by production environment. 
  I mostly worked for the B2B website.

- I worked for GridPocket (I am co-founder).
  This is a French startup specialized in Electric Grid.
  I created a private[^6] web application.
  One of the goal reached was to follow you electricity consumption in real time.
  It needed many different parts, from creating a Linux box to receive the signal
  to writing the server which handled the requests and serve the REST API.
  And also write a full javascript client that displayed nicely the informations.

- I've also written an iOS application to manage passwords[^4]

- I made some relatively popular blog posts considering my articles are most highly technical[^5]
