### Presentation

I am French with a Post Ph.D in Machine Learning[^10].
Furthermore I love web programming and design.

- During my Ph.D. I made a C++ program (github[^1] and resume[^2]).
  I coded most of standard HMM learning algorithms.
  I developed an algorithm which I invented during my Ph.D. which use some operational optimization algorithm.
  During this period I published articles in international conferences and
  I taught Computer Science to college students.

- At the Hubert Curien Laboratory I made my post Ph.D.
  I developed a scientific application in Java/applet/JWS that should be used by biologists.
  The code has been updated a bit since my 6 month post Ph.D[^3].

- I worked in the web industry for Airfrance.
  My work environment was quite heterogeneous.
  From shell scripting to manage huge amount of data, web design
  and production environment.
  I mostly worked for the B2B Airfrance website.

- I worked for GridPocket (I am a co-founder).
  This is a French startup specialized in Electric Grid.
  I created a private[^6] web application.
  One of the goal reached was to follow you electricity consumption in real time.
  It needed many different parts, from creating a Linux box to receive the signal
  to writing the server which handled the requests and serve the REST API.
  And also write a full javascript client that displayed nicely the informations.

- I've also written an iOS application to manage passwords[^4].

- I am the author of some quite popular blog posts[^5].

- Currently I am working for Vigiglobe. I do Machine Learning and Software engineering.
  I worked first with `node.js` then we upgraded our stack to Clojure, Haskell &amp; Mesos.
  I worked on making a real time analytics of social media content.
  We do real time sentiment analysis. We had to make a scalable architecture
  able to absorb and treat (Aggregation &amp; Machine Learning) thousands of messages per second.[^7]
